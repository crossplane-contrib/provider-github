## Overview

`provider-github` is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for
[GitHub](https://github.com/). The provider that is built from the source code
in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the
following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model GitHub infrastructure and
  services
* Controllers to provision these resources in GitHub based on the users desired
  state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource
  abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/concepts.html), enabling
  GitHub resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
